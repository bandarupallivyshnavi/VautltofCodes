            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Bandarupalli Venkata Naga Sri Vyshnavi, a passionate fresher eager to kickstart my career in the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Web Development. I have recently completed a certification in 'Introduction to AI' from Infosys Springboard and an AWS Skill Builder Course in Generative AI.</p>

            <h3>My Journey into AI, ML, and Web Development</h3>
            <p>My interest in AI and ML sparked during my undergraduate studies when I realized the potential of these technologies to transform industries and improve lives. Similarly, my enthusiasm for web development grew as I explored how websites can be powerful tools for communication and interaction. Since then, I have been dedicated to learning and mastering various aspects of AI, ML, and web development, driven by a desire to contribute to these exciting fields.</p>

            <h3>Skills and Projects</h3>
            <p>Throughout my learning journey, I have acquired a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, and I am proficient in using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for AI/ML projects. In web development, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have experience with frameworks such as Bootstrap and React. I have worked on several projects, including developing a to-do list web application and creating interactive user registration forms, which have helped me hone my skills and apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Goals and Aspirations</h3>
            <p>In the short term, I aim to deepen my understanding of AI, ML, and web development through hands-on projects and continuous learning. My long-term goal is to become a proficient engineer who can develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. I am particularly interested in exploring applications of AI in healthcare, finance, and education, as well as creating engaging and user-friendly web applications.</p>

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>Apart from my professional pursuits, I enjoy reading, traveling, and exploring new technologies. I am a simple, calm, and beautiful girl who believes in continuous growth and learning. I am excited about the endless possibilities that AI, ML, and web development offer and look forward to contributing to these transformative fields.</p>
